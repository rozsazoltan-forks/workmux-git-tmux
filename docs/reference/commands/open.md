description: Open or switch to a tmux window for an existing worktree
---

# open

Opens or switches to a tmux window for a pre-existing git worktree. If the window already exists, switches to it. If not, creates a new window with the configured pane layout and environment. Accepts multiple names to open several worktrees at once.

```bash
workmux open [name...] [flags]
```

## Arguments

- `[name...]`: One or more worktree names, matching the worktree directory or handle. The tmux target can differ when a worktree uses `--name-window` or `--name-session`. Optional with `--new` when run from inside a worktree.

## Options

| Flag                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-n, --new`                | Force opening in a new window even if one already exists. Creates a duplicate window with a suffix (e.g., `-2`, `-3`). Useful for having multiple terminal views into the same worktree. Cannot be used with session mode.                                                             |
| `--mode <window\|session>` | Override the multiplexer mode for this command. `session` persists the mode change for subsequent opens. `window` converts a session-mode worktree back to window mode. Session mode is only supported with tmux.                                                                      |
| `-s, --session`            | Shorthand for `--mode session`. Persists the mode change for subsequent opens. Cannot be combined with `--mode`.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `--name-window <name>`     | Override the tmux window target name for this command. In window mode, creates or selects `<window_prefix><name>` while keeping the worktree path unchanged. Cannot be used with session mode or multiple worktree names.                                                              |
| `--name-session <name>`    | Override the tmux session target for this command. In session mode, creates or selects `<window_prefix><name>`. In window mode, creates the window inside the named tmux session without applying `window_prefix` to that parent session. Cannot be used with multiple worktree names. |
| `--config <path>`          | Use an alternate config file for this invocation. Still merges with global config. Useful for per-command config overrides like `workmux open feat/my-branch --config /path/to/workmux.session.yaml`.                                                                                  |
| `--run-hooks`              | Re-runs the `post_create` commands (these block window creation).                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `--force-files`            | Re-applies file copy/symlink operations. Useful for restoring a deleted `.env` file.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `-p, --prompt <text>`      | Provide an inline prompt for AI agent panes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `-P, --prompt-file <path>` | Provide a path to a file containing the prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `-c, --continue`           | Resume the agent's most recent conversation in this worktree. Injects the appropriate flag for the configured agent (e.g., `--continue` for Claude, `--resume` for Gemini).                                                                                                            |
| `-e, --prompt-editor`      | Open your editor to write the prompt interactively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `--prompt-file-only`       | Write the prompt file to the worktree without injecting it into agent commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## What happens

1. Verifies that a worktree with `<name>` exists.
2. If the target exists and `--new` is not set, switches to it.
3. Otherwise, creates a new tmux window or session. `--name-window` can override the window target, and `--name-session` can override the session target or choose the parent session for a window-mode target.
4. (If specified) Runs file operations and `post_create` hooks.
5. Sets up your configured tmux pane layout.
6. Automatically switches your tmux client to the new window.

## Examples

```bash
# Open or switch to a window for an existing worktree
workmux open user-auth

# Force open a second window for the same worktree (creates user-auth-2)
workmux open user-auth --new

# Open a new window for the current worktree (run from within the worktree)
workmux open --new

# Open in session mode (converts from window mode if needed)
workmux open user-auth --mode session

# Convert a session-mode worktree back to a window
workmux open user-auth --mode window

# Recreate a closed worktree with a custom window target
workmux open user-auth --name-window review-auth

# Recreate a window-mode worktree inside a named tmux session
workmux open user-auth --name-session prs --name-window review-auth

# Recreate a worktree as a custom-named session
workmux open user-auth --mode session --name-session review-auth

# Resume the agent's last conversation
workmux open user-auth --continue

# Resume and send a follow-up prompt
workmux open user-auth --continue -p "Continue implementing the login flow"

# Open and re-run dependency installation
workmux open user-auth --run-hooks

# Open and restore configuration files
workmux open user-auth --force-files

# Open multiple worktrees at once
workmux open user-auth api-refactor bugfix-login
```
