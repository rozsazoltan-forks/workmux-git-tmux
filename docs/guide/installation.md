## Shell alias (recommended)

For faster typing, alias `workmux` to `wm`:

```bash
alias wm='workmux'
```

Add this to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent shell configuration file.

## Shell completions

To enable tab completions for commands and branch names, add the following to your shell's configuration file.

::: code-group

```bash [Bash]
# Add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(workmux completions bash)"
```

```bash [Zsh]
# Add to ~/.zshrc
eval "$(workmux completions zsh)"
```

```bash [Fish]
# Add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
workmux completions fish | source
```
